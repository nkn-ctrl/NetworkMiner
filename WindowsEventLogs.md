## Event Viewer
 The log files with the `.evtx` file extension typically reside in `C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs`. <br>

- System Logs: Records events associated with the Operating System segments. 
- Security Logs: Records events connected to logon and logoff activities on a device.
- Application Logs: Records events related to applications installed on a system. 
- Directory Service Events: Active Directory changes and activities are recorded in these logs, mainly on domain controllers.
- File Replication Service Events:
- DNS Event Logs: DNS servers use these logs to record domain events and to map out
- Custom Logs: Events are logged by applications that require custom data storage. This allows applications to control the log size or attach other parameters, such as ACLs, for security purposes.<br>
