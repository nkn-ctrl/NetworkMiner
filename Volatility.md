# Volatility 3

## Installing Volatility
https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3  
<br>

Download optional dependencies: 
- `yara-python 3.8.0` or `later`     https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara-python
- `capstone 3.0.0` or `later`    https://www.capstone-engine.org/download.html
<br>

Linux or Mac memory files:  https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3#symbol-tables  
<br>

## Memory Extraction
Dump tool  
- TK Imager
- Redline
- DumpIt.exe
- win32dd.exe / win64dd.exe
- Memoryze
- FastDump  

Out put `a .raw` file  
For virtual machines, gathering a memory file can easily be done by collecting the virtual memory file from the host machineâ€™s drive.  
- VMWare - `.vmem`
- Hyper-V - `.bin`
- Parallels - `.mem`
- VirtualBox - `.sav` file *\*this is only a partial memory file*  

## Identifying Image Info and Profiles
OS profiles have since been deprecated with Volatility3, so we will only need to worry about identifying the profile if using Volatility2; this makes life much easier for analyzing memory dumps.  
If we are still looking to get information about what the host is running from the memory dump, we can use the following three plugins `windows.info` `linux.info` `mac.info`.  
<br>

`python3 vol.py -f <file> windows.info`

## Listing Processes and Connections
### `pslist`
The most basic way of listing processes.this plugin will get the list of processes from the doubly-linked list that keeps track of processes in memory, equivalent to the process list in task manager.
`python3 vol.py -f <file> windows.pslist`

### `psscan`
Some malware, typically rootkits, will, in an attempt to hide their processes, `psscan`  will locate processes by finding data structures that match `_EPROCESS`. But it can also cause false positives.
`python3 vol.py -f <file> windows.psscan`  

###  `pstree`
`python3 vol.py -f <file> windows.pstree`

### `netstat`
netstat will attempt to identify all memory structures with a network connection.  
`python3 vol.py -f <file> windows.netstat`

### `dlllist`
This plugin will list all DLLs associated with processes at the time of extraction.  
`python3 vol.py -f <file> windows.dlllist`  

## Volatility Hunting and Detection Capabilities
### `malfind`
Hunting for code injection. The plugin works by scanning the heap and identifying processes that have the executable bit set `RWE` or `RX` and/or no memory-mapped file on disk (file-less malware).  
`python3 vol.py -f <file> windows.malfind`  

### `yarascan`
`yarascan` will search for strings, patterns, and compound rules against a rule set.
`python3 vol.py -f <file> yarascan.YaraScan --yara-file /path/to/yara/file.yara`
