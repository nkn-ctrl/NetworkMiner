[Initial Access Tactic (TA0001)](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0001/)  
The primary objective during this phase is to gain a foothold in the network, which can be achieved through a variety of means, such as:  
- Social Engineering techniques such as phishing.
- Exploiting vulnerabilities through public-facing servers.
- Spraying credentials through exposed authentication endpoints.
- Executing commands through malicious flash drives.
- Installing cracked software with hidden malicious code.  

The common intersection of the given examples above is gaining initial access to either of the following:
