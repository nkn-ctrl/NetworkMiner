- Password guessing is a technique used to target online protocols and services. Therefore, it's considered time-consuming and opens up the opportunity to generate logs for the failed login attempts. A password guessing attack conducted on a web-based system often requires a new request to be sent for each attempt, which can be easily detected. It may cause an account to be locked out if the system is designed and configured securely.
- Password cracking is a technique performed locally or on systems controlled by the attacker.
