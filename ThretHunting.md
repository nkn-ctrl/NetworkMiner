## Threat Hunting Methodology

### Documentation
- Clear, organized record-keeping
    • Methods used during attack
    • How the attack was detected
    • How the attack was stopped
- Makes it easier to communicate and study the exact nature of the threat
- Allows for more efficient response in the future if a similar attack occurs

### Communicaiton
- Keep stakeholders apprised of any incidents, findings, and impacts
    • Reduces number of surprises
    • Enables you to set expectations
    • Facilitates collaboration
    • Keeps analysts accountable
    • Helps the owner feel invested in the security process
- Note: Advanced threat actors often monitor communication. To avoid giving the attacker additional information, have a secure channel available that can be used to help prevent eavesdropping

### Patience & Persistence
• Conduct numerous investigations, even if it looks like there is no conclusion.
• Take time to thoroughly analyze and document all findings.
• Do not rush to conclusions or prematurely close an investigation.
• Patience and persistence help you improve your threat hunting 
skills.

### Adaptability
Threat hunters need to be able to rapidly adapt to new technologies, 
attack methods, and emerging threats.
This includes:
• Staying up-to-date with new tools, techniques, and tactics used by 
attackers.
• Being able to adjust hunting strategies and tactics as necessary.
• Being able to quickly respond to new threats and incidents.
• Being able to pivot to new areas of focus as needed.

### Collaboration
Threat hunters need to work with other members of the organization (including security analysts, network administrators, and others) in 
order to effectively respond to cyber threats.
By merging information and resources, everyone has a better chance of understanding the threat that you face.
Collaboration methods include:
• Sharing information with other teams and organizations, whether 
directly or via online platforms.
• Coordinating investigations and response tactics with other teams.
• Having regular meetings to discuss progress and share information.
• Using shared tools (such as SIEM systems) for data collection and 
analysis.
• Asking others to lend their expertise to a problem you may not be 
equipped to handle by yourself.

### Critical Thinking
Critical Thinking: the ability to analyze and evaluate information and 
situations in a logical and systematic manner in order to make sound 
decisions and judgments.
Critical thinking for Threat Hunting:
• Necessary for evaluating and analyzing large amounts of data, 
identifying patterns and anomalies, and making informed decisions 
about how to protect yourself from threats.
• Allows you to discover solutions that may not be obvious.
• Enables you to weigh the potential risks and benefits of various 
courses of action to best protect your organization

### Staying Current
Why is it necessary? Because change is imminent and inescapable.
Competitors, hackers, and Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) will all embrace new technologies as they search for ways to compromise systems.
Staying current by studying the latest technologies and security techniques is the best way to protect against new threats.

### Testing & Validation
Just because something worked at first does not mean that it can adequately protect you now.
Ask yourself: “Is this working correctly?”
Through testing & validation, you can:
• Identify security concerns
• Determine whether or not systems are giving you reliable information
• Improve existing systems
• Identify any gaps or weaknesses with your current security practices
• Collect evidence that will be necessary for proving compliance
