# SIEM
SIEM stands for Security Information and Event Management system.  

## Network Visibility through SIEM
1) Host-Centric Log Sources
- A user accessing a file
- A user attempting to authenticate.
- A process Execution Activity
- A process adding/editing/deleting a registry key or value.
- Powershell execution  

2) Network-Centric Log Sources
- SSH connection
- A file being accessed via FTP
- Web traffic
- A user accessing company's resources through VPN.
- Network file sharing Activity

## Log Sources and Log Ingestion
### Windows Machine
Windows records every event that can be viewed through the `Event Viewer` utility.   

### Linux Workstation
Linux OS stores all the related logs, such as events, errors, warnings, etc.
- `/var/log/httpd` : Contains HTTP Request  / Response and error logs.
- `/var/log/cron`   : Events related to cron jobs are stored in this location.
- `/var/log/auth.log` and `/var/log/secure` : Stores authentication related logs.
- `/var/log/kern` : This file stores kernel related events.

### Web Server
In Linux, common locations to write all apache related logs are `/var/log/apache` or `/var/log/httpd`.

## Analysing Logs and Alerts
### Dashboard
Dashboards are the most important components of any SIEM. SIEM presents the data for analysis after being normalized and ingested. Some of the information that can be found in a dashboard are:  
- Alert Highlights
- System Notification
- Health Alert
- List of Failed Login Attempts
- Events Ingested Count
- Rules triggered
- Top Domains Visited

## ELK
Investigate VPN logs through ELK.  
### Elastic stack
Elastic stack is the collection of different open source components linked together to help users take the data from any source and in any format and perform a search, analyze and visualize the data in real-time.

# Incident handling with Splunk
## Incident Handling Life Cycle
1. Preparation  
Readiness of an organization against an attack.Documenting the requirements, defining the policies, incorporating the security controls to monitor like EDR / SIEM / IDS / IPS, etc. and also hiring/training the staff.
2. Detection and Analysis  
This phase covers getting alerts from the security controls like SIEM/EDR investigating the alert to find the root cause. 
3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery  
This phase covers the actions needed to prevent the incident from spreading and securing the network.
4. Post-Incident Activity / Lessons Learnt  
This phase includes identifying the loopholes in the organization's security posture, which led to an intrusion, and improving so that the attack does not happen next time. 

## Cyber Kill Chain

### Scenario
A Big corporate organization Wayne Enterprises has recently faced a cyber-attack where the attackers broke into their network, found their way to their web server, and have successfully defaced their website `http://www.imreallynotbatman.com`. Their website is now showing the trademark of the attackers with the message YOUR SITE HAS BEEN DEFACED.
#### Splunk
During our investigation, we will be using Splunk as our SIEM solution. Logs are being ingested from webserver/firewall/Suricata/Sysmon etc. 
#### Interesting log Sources
|Log Sources|Details|
|:---------:|-------|
|wineventlog|It contains Windows Event logs |
|winRegistry|It contains the logs related to registry creation / modification / deletion etc.|
|XmlWinEventLog|It contains the sysmon event logs. It is a very important log source from an investigation point of view.|
|fortigate_utm|It contains Fortinet Firewall logs|
|iis|It contains IIS web server logs|
|Nessus:scan|It contains the results from the Nessus vulnerability scanner.|
|Suricata|It contains the details of the alerts from the Suricata IDS.   This log source shows which alert was triggered and what caused the alert to get triggeredâ€” a very important log source for the Investigation. |
|stream:http|It contains the network flow related to http traffic.|
|stream: DNS|It contains the network flow related to DNS traffic.|
|stream:icmp|It contains the network flow related to icmp traffic.|


## Reconnaissance Phase
We will start our analysis by examining any reconnaissance attempt against the webserver `imreallynotbatman.com`.  
Search Query: `index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com`  
<br>

Where do we first need to look? If we look at the available log sources, we will find some log sources covering the network traffic.  
Search Query: `index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com sourcetype=stream:http`  

### Validate the IP that is scanning
So what do we need to do to validate the scanning attempt? Look into the suricata logs.  
Search Query: `index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com src=40.80.148.42 sourcetype=suricata`
